Failed Test Case
The test case test_invalid_data_handling failed because of an issue in the month_issue_analysis.py file:
python
if issue['created_at'].month:

Error:
AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'month'
This occurred because the created_at field in the test data contained an invalid string ('invalid_date'), which caused the code to attempt accessing .month on a string instead of a valid datetime object.
Is This Alright?
No, this is not acceptable because:
The test case is valid and highlights a real issue with how invalid data is handled.
The failure indicates that the code does not gracefully handle malformed or invalid date inputs, which could lead to runtime errors in production.
How to Fix This
1. Update the Code to Handle Invalid Dates
Modify the month_issue_analysis.py file to safely parse dates and handle invalid inputs. Use try-except to catch errors during date parsing.
