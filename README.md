# ENPM611 Project Group 2



### Install dependencies

In the root directory of the application, create a virtual environment, activate that environment, and install the dependencies like so:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Download and configure the data file

Download the data file (in `json` format) from the project assignment in Canvas and update the `config.json` with the path to the file. Note, you can also specify an environment variable by the same name as the config setting (`ENPM611_PROJECT_DATA_PATH`) to avoid committing your personal path to the repository.


### Run an analysis

With everything set up, you should be able to run the existing example analysis:

```
python run.py --feature 0
```

That will output basic information about the issues to the command line.
